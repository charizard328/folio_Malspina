      <h2>Project Info</h2>
      <h4>A glacier is an aggregate of a few drops of water
that has grown little by little over millions of years.
It is still growing and has enormous and massive
energy. This gigantic flow, basically a river-like
motion, however, is gradual enough that erosion
and sedimentation can not be compared with river
action. Only records collected over decades will
demonstrate the dynamics of the glacier.<p>
In gigantic energy flows, glaciers have various
properties in response to temperature, pressure,
velocity, bedrock shape, and so on. It does not
flow, it piles up, it flows down, it carries down the
bedrock, and the friction force with the bedrock also
develops the crevasse on the surface of the glacier.
A glacier is both a solid and a flowing plastic.<p>
This study of journey of glacier from a deep
mountain range to reach sea level is a survey of
various terrains that glaciers have or are exposed
from glaciers.</h4>
